For a long time prevalent approach to creating a company around Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurency) was, build it and they will come.

As such businesses need to provide some tangible benefit to the end user, beyond doing "X"  with whatever-cryptocurrency. 

There seems to be a change though, with more recent product offerings veering more strongly into offering services and using Bitcoin as a facilitating tool. I can see this becoming more common as these products manage to find product-market fit.
