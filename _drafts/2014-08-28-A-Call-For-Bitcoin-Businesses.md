title: A Call For Bitcoin Businesses
---

**TL;DR** If you are a business owner/founder and sell a product please take 15 minutes to [talk to me](alexmanusu.youcanbook.me) about why you decided to accept/not accept Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and the underlying technical innovations of the blockchain and digital scarcity are some of the most exciting developments occurring at the moment. A large portion of the academic community around cyrptocurrencies are mainly interested in understanding/advancing either the technical underpinnings of these innovations, or the effects of cyrptocurrencies at a broad macroeconomic level. 

I want to take a step back and understand what it is that is causing people to use Bitcoin. There are people who are [tracking adoption metrics](http://www.bitcoinpulse.com/), others who are looking more [directly at the community](http://simulacrum.cc/2013/03/04/the-demographics-of-bitcoin-part-1-updated/) and a number of developments on the [academic](http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/Luther_CryptocurrenciesNetworkEffects_v1.pdf) side as well. 

There has been very little to no research into why merchants actually decide to accept Bitcoin, or on the flip side the biggest issues that they see in accepting it. Although this is only one half of the equation it is an important step in legitimising Bitcoin and it's usage.

As part of my research I'm aiming to answer the question of what factors are presenting the biggest roadblocks to merchants, so I'm putting this out there as an open call to the Bitcoin community. If you know about Bitcoin and own/work in a small business that sell a product I'd love to have a quick 15 minute chat about your thoughts on why you chose to accept (or not accept) Bitcoin. 

You can grab a time with me [here](alexmanusu.youcanbook.me) if you have 15 minutes to talk about your business and why you do/don't accept Bitcoin
