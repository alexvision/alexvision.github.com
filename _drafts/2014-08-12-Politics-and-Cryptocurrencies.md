title: Politics and Cryptocurrencies
---

From what I have seen there are a number of divisions that exist in the cryptocurency communities. There are those who think that bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency, and those who are more hopeful for altcoins. There are those who think cryptocurrency [applications are the future](https://medium.com/zapchain-magazine/stop-what-youre-doing-and-start-a-bitcoin-company-665ecfd395d0) and those who think [investment is the end game for bitcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/). The last difference that I'll mention here is the rainbow of political viewpoints cryptocurrency enthusiasts have. 

This broad range of political viewpoints results in points of contention inside the community, which is not a concern. What is concerning is the use of misleading information to progress an agenda. A good example of this is the recent claims around the executive order allowing the US to sieze cryptoassets  


[Daniel Krawisz](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-two-ideologies-in-bitcoin/) provides a good arguement over the differences between these groups, but argues that these viewpoints do not tie back to any individual political view point. 


From all the people I have met in the bitcoin comunity there seems to be a divide. There are those who are interested politically and those who are not particuarly concerned with any of the political implications of cryptocurrencies. 

Bitcoin has had a long connection with those of the Libertarian persuasion, in fact many people in the Bitcoin ecosystem go as far as needing to identify themselves as libertarian before discussing their interpretation and understanding of cryptocurrencies. It has also been noted as a libertarian's dream currency, with the seperation of state and currency that crytocurrencies present.
