title: Merchant Adoption and Consumer Adoption
---

There was a big push to get more merchants to accept cryptocurrencies through the later stages of 2013 and early 2014. That resulted in a number of big merchants signing up to accept Bitcoin such as Microsoft and Dell. The news of [Paypal taking another step towards accepting Bitcoin](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/breaking-paypal-merchants-can-now-accept-bitcoin/) is the latest indication that if there is demand merchants are likely to jump on board. Unfortunately most of what I have seen suggests that the number of sales in Bitcoin is below what the companies expected and there is some evidence of that from [some](http://www.coindesk.com/overstocks-2014-bitcoin-sales-miss-projections-3-million/) companies [public comments](https://fundraising.mozilla.org/bitcoin-donations-to-mozilla-17-days-in/).

This suggests that we are seeing merchants adoption fast out-pacing consumer adoption. If we consider that most companies accepting Bitcoin are not keeping it as a currency, rather they use it as a payment network. The fact that merchants aren't holding Bitcoin is creating an interesting dynamic which seems to be quite closely related to how smart-cards are adopted(e.g. Oyster card in London, Octopus card in Hong Kong). Using [Rochet and Triole's model](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/154247603322493212/abstract) for two sided markets we end up with a model similar to the one shown below.

We appear to currently be in a stage where the adoption by merchants has far outstripped the demand for consumers to spend Bitcoin (i.e. somewhere on one of the red lines). So my guess is that we won't see as many major companies accepting Bitcoin in 2015, or until we see an increase in willingness for consumers to buy things with Bitcoin which is usually occurs when the price increases. 

It will be interesting to see how willing the consumer side will be to spend Bitcoin, as the deflationary nature of the currency would suggest that consumers are less incentivised to spend, which will likely make the consumer adoption even more exponential (flatter for longer with a sharp rise at the end). 

Some merchants have offered discounts to try and get more users buying with Bitcoin, but I'm not aware of any companies that have released any numbers around how a discount impacts usage of Bitcoin. Of course discounts are likely to increase sales, but by how much, or more interestingly at what price did the consumers buy their Bitcoin at. 

For the meantime we are seeing traders increasing the volume of trades as the traders try and profit off the volatility of the currency rather than looking for an absolute high price which attracted the speculators which drove the price up in late 2013.
