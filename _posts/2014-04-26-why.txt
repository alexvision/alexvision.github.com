title: Why?
---

So, why am I starting a blog? 

I felt that I needed to start recording down both what I'm doing and my thoughts and opinions. This isn't specifically for anyone but myself. It allows me to keep a record of what I thought, and forces me to clarify what I have been thinking by actually writing it down. 

I've tried keeping journals, I've tried to write little notes to myself, and I simply forget after a few weeks. Then it becomes a regular thing that I forget to do. So having a public forum to present my ideas might force me to be more regular, thorough and hopefully insightful with my ideas.
